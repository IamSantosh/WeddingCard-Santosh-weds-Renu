Welcome to the Santosh Renu wedding App.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously and I know that our users ("you," "your") care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. There's no data is created by the you (the user) in the app or stored on your device. We didn't collect any imformation related to you and this app only used for showing the dates of your relative Wedding. You can simply erased all information by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Questions or concerns
If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please feel free to contact us anytime at santosh.btkit@gmail.com. We will make every effort to resolve your concerns.

Yours sincerely,
Santosh Rawat
